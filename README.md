**1. Initialization:**

The environment is initialized with parameters such as whether to enable rendering (_render_) and whether to have a random target (_random_target_).
It sets up the parameters for the robotic arm, such as the joint variables, and initializes the Pygame window for rendering if enabled.

**2. Observation Space and Action Space:**
The observation space is a Box space representing the state of the environment, including:
* Joint angles (_self.theta_)
* End effector position (_self.get_end_effector_position()_)
* Target position (_self.target_)
* Screen dimensions (_self.width and self.height_)
  
The action space is also a Box space representing the control inputs for each joint, where each action corresponds to a change in joint angle.

**3 Resetting the Environment (_reset method_):**

* Initializes the environment at the beginning of an episode.
* Resets the joint angles, sets the current step to 1, and generates a new target position if _random_target_ is enabled.
* Returns the initial observation.
  
**4. Taking a Step (_step method_):**

* Takes an action as input and updates the environment accordingly.
* Adjusts the joint angles based on the action.
* Calculates the distance between the end effector and the target.
* Computes the reward based on the distance.
* Checks if the episode is done based on the distance threshold or maximum steps.
* Returns the next observation, reward, done flag, and additional information.

**5. Rendering the Environment (_render method_):**

* Visualizes the current state of the environment using Pygame.
* Draws the robotic arm segments, target position, end effector position, and grid lines on the screen.
* Displays the reward value on the screen.

**6. Closing the Environment (_close method_):**

* Closes the Pygame window when the environment is no longer needed.

**Reward Design:**

- The reward is designed to incentivize the agent to move the end effector closer to the target position.
- The reward is calculated as the negative Euclidean distance between the end effector and the target position.
- The closer the end effector is to the target, the higher the reward, and vice versa.

Mathematically, the reward _r_ at time step _t_ can be defined as:

r<sub>t</sub>  =−∥end effector position − target position∥

This design encourages the agent to minimize the distance between the end effector and the target, leading to successful completion of the task.
